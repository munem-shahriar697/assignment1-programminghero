                <p>I am going to finish the Web Development course on programming hero. Inshallah I will be on the SCIC
                    group which will allow me to go further as a web developer.</p>

                <h2>Vission</h2>
                <p>I have to get an internship or a part-time job a a junior web developer in this year. Also it might
                    be a
                    far fetched idea but I want to pay my own tuition fee and prove others that I am capable of doing
                    things.</p>

                <p>I am going to do
                    some
                    of my own projects which are inspired by my own thoughts. I just want to make eye-pleasing website
                    with
                    my current skills. After a few months these different projects will show me how much I have improved
                    as
                    a web developer.</p>

            <p>For although a man is judged by his actions, by what he has said and done, a man judges himself by what
                he is willing to do, by what he might have said, or might have done – a judgment that is necessarily
                hampered, bot only by the scope and limits of his imagination, but by the ever-changing measure of his
                doubt and self-esteem.</p>

            <p>In the hospital men’s room, as I’m washing my hands, I glance in the mirror. The man I see is not so much
                me as my father. When did he show up? There is no soap; I rub hand sanitizer into my face–it burns. I
                nearly drown myself in the sink trying to rinse it off.</p>
